# Fidget Spinner Game

Welcome to the Fidget Spinner Game GitHub repository! This simple yet entertaining game is built with Python and the Turtle Graphics library. The game is based on the original code by Grant Jenks, available in the [free-python-games repository](https://github.com/grantjenks/free-python-games/blob/master/src/freegames/fidget.py).

## About the Game

The Fidget Spinner game is a virtual simulation of a real-life fidget spinner. The game uses the Turtle Graphics library to draw a fidget spinner with three colored sections (red, green, and blue). Players can "flick" the spinner by pressing the spacebar, causing the spinner to rotate. The speed of the spinner will gradually decrease over time, and the player can flick it again to increase its speed.

## Getting Started

To run the game, you need to have Python 3 installed on your system. Additionally, you'll need the Turtle Graphics library, which comes pre-installed with most Python distributions.

Follow these steps to get started:

Clone this repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fidget-spinner-game.git
```

Navigate to the directory

```bash
cd fidget-spinner-game
```

## How To Play

Run the PyGame version of the game
```bash
python -m app.pygame_version.main
```

Run the Turtle version of the game
```bash
python -m app.turtle_version.main
```

Press the **spacebar** to flick the fidget spinner.
